Web Programming Repository

I learned how to clone, fork, commit, push, and pull a repository using git and github

I also learned that two changes on the same line that haven't been pushed to github will create a conflict; the conflict can be resolved by merging the files

Elevator Pitch -
I want to create a website to help people better manage their life. They will have the ability to create goals and plans, as well as to keep track of their schedule and track their progress. I don't want to target a specific aspect of life like a nutrition or workout progress tracker, instead I want to help people in every aspect of their lives. The website will have a simple layout and will be easy to use. No need to complicate things.
