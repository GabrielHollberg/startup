Web Programming Repository

I learned how to clone, fork, commit, push, and pull a repository using git and github

I also learned that two changes on the same line that haven't been pushed to github will create a conflict; the conflict can be resolved by merging the files

Elevator Pitch -
I want to create a website to help people better manage their life. They will have the ability to create goals and plans, as well as to keep track of their schedule and track their progress. I don't want to target a specific aspect of life like a nutrition or workout progress tracker, instead I want to help people in every aspect of their lives. The website will have a simple layout and will be easy to use. No need to complicate things.

Simon html -
While working on the simon html project I learned a few cool things. One is that when you use an a tag you should use it on the inside of formatting tags. I did it on the outside at first and it made an entire line on my website a hyperlink. I also learned more about the form tag. It will be interesting to learn more about css after using some of html's outdated formatting tools.

CSS -
Animation in CSS is actually super cool. Remember use @keyframes to define states at different percentages of the animation. then use animation in css with whatever you used for your keyframes name and an amount of time like 2s

Responsive Design -
Always include this meta tag in the html head tag
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
This will prevent automatic browser scaling on devices

Simon css -
While working on the simon css project I learned how to use the bootstrap framework. This framework is included in a link tag and uses classes to style a webpage. I also learned a little about w3.css and think I like it even better than bootstrap.
